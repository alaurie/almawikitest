### 🌟 Introduction

This guide provides instructions on how to install NVIDIA's graphics driver for AlmaLinux in two variants:

* **Binary Driver** [**8.x**](SystemSeriesA03R8.md) | [**9.x**](SystemSeriesA03R9.md) 👈 USING PRECOMPILED DRIVERS IS RECOMMENDED
* **Compiling From Source** [**8.x**](SystemSeriesA03R8.md) | [**9.x**](SystemSeriesA03R9.md) ⚠️ REQURIES SWITCHING TO ELRepo KERNEL
* **.run Driver** REQURIES manual installation of dependencies and downloading the driver manually from Nvidia website

### 🧠 Fundamental Concepts

#### Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS)

DKMS is a system utility that allows you to automatically build kernel modules.

#### ELRepo Kernel

ELRepo is a community repository for Enterprise Linux distributions (e.g., RHEL, CentOS, AlmaLinux). It focuses on hardware-related packages to enhance your Linux experience. This repo provides a kernel (packages) which tracks mainline kernel very closely. In result, this kernel is updated frequently and sometimes it leads to temporary incompatiblity with NVIDIA driver sources.

#### NVIDIA Drivers Source

Install the NVIDIA graphics driver using the DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support). Needs switching the kernel to ELRepo kernel version.

#### NVIDIA Precompiled/Binary Drivers

NVIDIA compiles and tests this driver for each precise kernel version. Installing it locks your kernel upgrade (with driver). It is the recommended way according to NVIDIA.

#### Understanding NVIDIA .run Driver Installation

The NVIDIA .run Driver Installation Guide offers an alternative approach to installing the graphics driver on AlmaLinux. Unlike the recommended precompiled drivers, this method allows users to manually handle the installation process. It involves downloading the driver directly from the Nvidia website, making it a more flexible but intricate process.

## Key Points

* **Manual Dependency Installation:** Users are required to install dependencies manually, ensuring compatibility with the system.
* **Direct Download from Nvidia:** The graphics driver needs to be downloaded manually from the Nvidia website, allowing users to choose specific versions compatible with their GPUs.
* **Flexibility and Control:** This method provides users with greater control over the installation process, enabling customization based on specific needs.

## Considerations

* **Advanced Users:** The .run Driver Installation Guide is suitable for advanced users who are comfortable handling manual installations and configurations.
* **Compatibility Verification:** Users must verify the compatibility of the downloaded driver version with their GPU before proceeding with the installation.

### FAQ

#### Q: Installed the module but getting Black Screen after reboot?

**If you are able to change `GRUB` kernel boot parameters, do:**

```
module_blacklist=nvidia,nvidia_drm,nvida_modeset
```

**If you are getting Black Screen right after boot (no GRUB visible), do:**

#### If the Desktop Icon for NVIDIA-Settings is not showing, do :

````
sudo echo "[Desktop Entry]" | sudo tee /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop
sudo echo "Type=Application" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop
sudo echo "Name=NVIDIA Settings" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktopsudo
sudo echo "Comment=Configure NVIDIA Settings" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/applications/nv```idia-settings.desktop
sudo echo "Exec=nvidia-settings" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop
sudo echo "Icon=nvidia-settings" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop
sudo echo "Terminal=false" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop
sudo echo "Categories=System;Settings;X-Red-Hat-Base-Utilities;" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop
